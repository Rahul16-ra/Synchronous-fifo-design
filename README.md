# Synchronous-fifo-design
A parameterizable synchronous FIFO design operating on a single shared clock for both read and write. It uses a circular buffer with separate read and write pointers, a memory array, and a counter-based mechanism to generate full and empty flags. Includes synchronous reset and configurable data/address widths for reliable same-clock buffering only
